# SimpleForm #

SimpleForm is a form processing library with a slight twist. Rather than the conventional approach of building a form using an API and outputting cruddy HTML, SimpleForm parses forms straight from your HTML. Once parsed, the form is accessible via an object oriented API, which allows individual form elements to be manipulated, changed and validated whilst preserving the surrounding markup.
